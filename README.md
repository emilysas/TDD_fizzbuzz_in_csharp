# TDD_fizzbuzz_in_csharp

Having begun to wrap my head around the C# syntax, I decided to try writing fizzbuzz again, but using a different method and TDD (via NUnit). This was a lot more challenging than I thought, and took a while to complete, however I feel I've learned A LOT. Not only did this improve my C#, but I became aware of design flaws that I had been unwittingly perpetuating in Ruby - C# simply won't let you get away with things like Ruby does!
